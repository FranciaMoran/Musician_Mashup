# Musician Mashup


Musician Mashup is an app which utilizes React and Node to create a hub for musicians. The user begins by creating an account by clicking on the "Create  Account" link and filling out the listed fields. (There is also a demo account set up for those who would prefer to preview the app without creating an account.) Once logged in, the user can customize their profile and create a band. The user can also search the database for other users by location in the "search musicians" page.

The functionality of the Musician Mashup app is accomplished with use of: React, CSS, JavaScript, Mlab, Node.js and heroku.

The repository which holds the node.js code for this project can be viewed here.
